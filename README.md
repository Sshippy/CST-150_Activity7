# CST-150_Activity7
Refer to the “Activity 7 Example” and page 290 in Starting Out with Visual C#. Write a Windows Forms Application that prompts the user for a number of terms and CALCULATES the value of the sequence for the specified number of terms; include a screenshot of your program running with successful output. (YOU MUST USE A FOR LOOP TO DO THIS.) Do not round your result.

What I learned
I learned how to calculate PI effectively. 
Challenges I faced
For this assignment the only challenge I ran into really was doing this assignment as a different assignment and then having to create a whole new assignment to use this one for this assignment. It took me one day, but I was able to effectively create another program to use for assignment 2 so i could use this one for this assignment. What I plan to do from now on is to look at the weeks ahead to make sure this does not happen again.
